## Research Interests

- Hardware security
- Side-channel analysis
- Neural networks 

## Current Research

My current research focuses on usage of statistical leakage assessment methods, commonly used for cryptograpgic implementations, for evaluating the security of neural networks implemented on MCU or FPGA. 
I study side-channel leakages in neural networks inference and analyze performance of existing evaluation techniques.
